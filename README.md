# LearningJava

## History

This repo was created originally for learning Java when I had just got a job in Nanjing about 8 years ago. But I didn't stay there long - just a month - and then left. I totally forget about it and such long time is gone when I suddenly remember its existence today.

## Now and Future

I still do not know how I will use it, but one possibility is for storing the source code I write for teaching.
