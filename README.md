# LearningJava

This repo was created originally for learning Java when I had just got a job in Nanjing about 8 years ago. But I didn't stay there long - just a month - and then left. I totally forget about it and such long time is gone when I suddenly remember its existence today.

Anyway, I hope that I will be using it again and it will help me with everything, considering the awkward situation I am in at the moment.
